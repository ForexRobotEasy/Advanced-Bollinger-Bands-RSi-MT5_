# Advanced Bollinger Bands RSi MT5

This code is an indicator for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) that combines Bollinger Bands and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to generate signals for overbought and oversold conditions in the market. It was developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and is available on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com).

## Indicator Parameters

The indicator has several input parameters that can be customized:

- `BB_Period`: The period used for calculating Bollinger Bands.
- `BB_Deviation`: The standard deviation used for calculating Bollinger Bands.
- `RSI_Period`: The period used for calculating RSI.
- `Overbought_Level`: The RSI level that defines an overbought condition.
- `Oversold_Level`: The RSI level that defines an oversold condition.
- `SL_Mode`: The stop loss mode, which can be set to `SL_FIXED` (fixed stop loss), `SL_TRAILING` (trailing stop loss), or `SL_INDICATOR` (dynamic stop loss based on indicators).
- `TP_Definition`: The take profit definition, which can be set to `TP_FIXED` (fixed take profit), `TP_INDICATOR` (dynamic take profit based on indicators), or `TP_MULTIPLE` (multiple take profit levels).

## Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers for Bollinger Bands and RSI, assigns labels to the buffers, sets the indicator style and colors, and initializes the indicator parameters. The short name of the indicator is set to 'AdvBBRSi'.

## Indicator Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new tick and is responsible for calculating the Bollinger Bands, RSI, and generating signals for overbought and oversold conditions.

First, the Bollinger Bands are calculated using the `BollingerBands()` function. The function takes the number of bars to calculate, the shift value, the period, standard deviation, shift value, mode (SMA in this case), the closing prices, and the buffers for the upper and lower bands.

Next, the RSI is calculated using the `RSI()` function. The function takes the number of bars to calculate, the shift value, the period, the closing prices, and the buffer for the RSI values.

Finally, a loop iterates over the new bars since the last calculation and checks for overbought and oversold conditions. If the upper band of the Bollinger Bands is greater than the closing price and the RSI value is above the overbought level, a signal is generated for the overbought condition. Similarly, if the lower band of the Bollinger Bands is less than the closing price and the RSI value is below the oversold level, a signal is generated for the oversold condition.
